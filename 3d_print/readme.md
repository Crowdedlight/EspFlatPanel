# 3D prints
The freecad models were made by https://github.com/jlecomte And is available here: https://github.com/jlecomte/ascom-wireless-flat-panel/tree/master/3D_Files under MIT license. I only included them here for my own organisational purpose. I urge you to go check out his project! 

It was his project that inspired me to make my own ESP32 driver without needing a custom ASCOM driver. Go check out his repo, some very nice information there especially on the mechanical side of building the flat panel.
